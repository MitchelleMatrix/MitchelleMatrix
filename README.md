## Hi there 👋
Welcome to My Corner of the Internet 🚀
Who Am I?
I'm Mitchell, a passionate IT student on a journey through code and creativity. Whether it's Data Structures, Algorithms, or turning logic into magic, I thrive on making things work (and debugging when they don’t).

What You'll Find Here 🔍
Cool projects 

Random tech experiments – sometimes things break, and that’s part of the fun

Notes & guides – because future me (and maybe you) might need them

Beyond Code 💡
When I’m not immersed in a terminal, you’ll find me:
📷 Capturing memories with my niece and nephew
✍️ Writing in creative calligraphy
📚 Exploring the depths of discrete mathematics (and questioning my life choices)
🎮 Occasionally watching my laptop overheat from Roblox

Let’s Connect! 🌍
💬 Always up for a tech chat or a coding challenge

🛠️ Open to collaborations, cool ideas, and innovative projects

☕ If you're into deep tech discussions over coffee, we’re already friends

🚀 "The best way to predict the future is to create it." Let's build something awesome together!
